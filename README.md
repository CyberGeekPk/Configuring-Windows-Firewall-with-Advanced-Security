# Configuring-Windows-Firewall-with-Advanced-Security
This project demonstrates how inbound and outbound rules can be managed programmatically, mimicking real-world firewall behavior. Features include rule creation, editing, deletion, and real-time filtering based on ports, protocols, and application paths.

## Objective

A simulated implementation and interface inspired by the native Windows Firewall with Advanced Security, allowing users to manage inbound/outbound rules, filter traffic by port, protocol, and application, and understand core firewall and network security concepts. Designed to enhance understanding of firewall architecture, rule hierarchies, and network security principles.
